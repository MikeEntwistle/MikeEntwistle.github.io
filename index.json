Rev. B 103, 125155 (2021)] allow us to compute the exact coupling-constant dependent exchange-correlation kernel within linear response time-dependent density functional theory. This permits an improved understanding of ground-state total energies derived from the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem (ACFDT). We consider both `one-shot' and `self-consistent' ACFDT calculations, and demonstrate that chemical accuracy is reliably preserved when the frequency dependence in the exact functional fxc[n](w=0) is neglected. This performance is understood on the grounds that the exact fxc[n] varies slowly over the most relevant w range (but not in general), and hence the spatial structure in fxc[n](w=0) is able to largely remedy the principal issue in the present context: self-interaction (examined from the perspective of the exchange-correlation hole). Moreover, we find that the implicit orbitals contained within a self-consistent ACFDT calculation utilizing the adiabatic exact kernel fxc[n](w=0) are remarkably similar to the exact Kohn-Sham orbitals, thus further establishing that the majority of the physics required to capture the ground-state total energy resides in the spatial dependence of fxc[n] at w=0.","tags":[],"title":"Accurate Total Energies from the Adiabatic-Connection Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem","type":"publication"},{"authors":["N.

Methods used to ensure the numerical robustness of fxc are set out. The frequency dependence of fxc is found to be largely due to its analytic structure, i.e., its singularities at certain frequencies, which are required in order to capture particular transitions, including those of double excitation character. However, within the frequency range of the first few interacting excitations, fxc is approximately w independent, meaning the exact adiabatic approximation fxc(w=0) remedies the failings of the local density approximation and random phase approximation for these lowest transitions. The key differences between the exact fxc and its common approximations are analyzed, and cannot be eliminated by exploiting the limited gauge freedom in fxc. The optical spectrum benefits from using as accurate as possible an fxc and ground-state xc potential, while maintaining exact compatibility between the two is of less importance.","tags":[],"title":"Insights from exact exchange-correlation kernels","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   Table of Contents  What you will learn Program overview Courses in this program Meet your instructor FAQs    What you will learn  Fundamental Python programming skills Statistical concepts and how to apply them in practice Gain experience with the Scikit, including data visualization with Plotly and data wrangling with Pandas  Program overview The demand for skilled data science practitioners is rapidly growing.

We previously introduced a set of alternative LDAs constructed from one-dimensional systems of one, two, and three electrons that resemble the HEG within a finite region. We now construct a HEG-based LDA appropriate for spinless electrons in one dimension and find that it is remarkably similar to the finite LDAs. As expected, all LDAs are inadequate in low-density systems where correlation is strong. However, exploring the small but significant differences between the functionals, we find that the finite LDAs give better densities and energies in high-density exchange-dominated systems, arising partly from a better description of the self-interaction correction.","tags":[],"title":"Comparison of local density functionals based on electron gas and finite systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.
